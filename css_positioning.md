CSS Positioning

***Fixed*** positioning ’fixes‘ the position of an element relative to the browser window. The element always stays fixed in 
place, even when scrolling.

***Absolute*** positioning takes an element out of document flow, meaning the browser acts as if the element has no width and 
height, and the other elements on the page move up as if it was never there. The position of the element is then fixed 
relative to the top level container, or the closest parent with a set positioning.

***Relative*** positioning sets the position of an element relative to its original position. The element's original width and 
height is retained in document flow and other elements behave as if it was in its original position.
